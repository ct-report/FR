Contact Tracing - France

**STOPCOVID** in development by INRIA. Centralized solution based on PEPP-PT protocol (ROBERT implementation). 

Until now, the French government keeps on supporting the usage of such a centralized model, unlike other countries, which have changed their programs (for instance Germany and Italy) by switching to decentralized solutions.
