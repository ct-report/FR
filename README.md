Contact Tracing - France

**STOPCOVID** in development by INRIA. Centralized solution - based on PEPP-PT protocol (ROBERT implementation). 

Until now, the French government keeps on supporting the usage of such a centralized model, unlike other countries, which have changed their programs (for instance Germany and Italy) by withdrawing from PEPP-PT & switching to decentralized solutions.

On May 12th SDK sources for ROBERT implementation have been released on Gitlab by INRIA.
